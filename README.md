## Part 1: WeatherPy
<<<<<<< HEAD
In this deliverable, you'll create a Python script to visualize the 
weather of over 500 cities of varying distances from the equator. You'll 
use the citipy Python library Links to an external site., the 
OpenWeatherMap API Links to an external site., and your problem-solving 
skills to create a representative model of weather across cities.

To fulfill the first requirement, you'll use the OpenWeatherMap API to 
retrieve weather data from the cities list generated in the starter code. 
Next, you'll create a series of scatter plots to showcase the following 
relationships:

To fulfill the first requirement, you'll use the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather data from the cities list generated in the starter code. Next, you'll create a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:
>>>>>>> origin/main

- Latitude vs. Temperature

- Latitude vs. Humidity

- Latitude vs. Cloudiness

- Latitude vs. Wind Speed

<<<<<<< HEAD
To fulfill the second requirement, compute the linear regression for each 
relationship. Separate the plots into Northern Hemisphere (greater than or 
equal to 0 degrees latitude) and Southern Hemisphere (less than 0 degrees 
latitude).

>>>>>>> origin/main
You should create the following plots:

- Northern Hemisphere: Temperature vs. Latitude

- Southern Hemisphere: Temperature vs. Latitude

- Northern Hemisphere: Humidity vs. Latitude

- Southern Hemisphere: Humidity vs. Latitude

- Northern Hemisphere: Cloudiness vs. Latitude

- Southern Hemisphere: Cloudiness vs. Latitude

- Northern Hemisphere: Wind Speed vs. Latitude

- Southern Hemisphere: Wind Speed vs. Latitude

## Part 2: VacationPy
<<<<<<< HEAD
In this deliverable, you'll use your weather data skills to plan future 
vacations. Also, you'll use Jupyter notebooks, the geoViews Python 
library, and the Geoapify API.
Your main tasks will be to use the Geoapify API and the geoViews Python 
library and employ your Python skills to create map visualizations.
- Create a map that displays a point for every city in the city_data_df 
DataFrame. The size of the point should be the humidity in each city.
- Narrow down the city_data_df DataFrame to find your ideal weather 
condition.
- Create a new DataFrame called hotel_df to store the city, country, 
coordinates, and humidity.
- For each city, use the Geoapify API to find the first hotel located 
within 10,000 meters of your coordinates.
- Add the hotel name and the country as additional information in the 
hover message for each city on the map
